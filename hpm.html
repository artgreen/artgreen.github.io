In the Hubitat® environment, the loss of the hub is significant, and while the Hub Protection service provides for a replacement hub and permits restoration of the hub’s data and radios there is a delay before the restoration can occur due to shipping. In the ideal world, a secondary hub would be on hot standby and would automatically assume control of the environment if it detected a failure (loss of communication in the primary hub).</td>
